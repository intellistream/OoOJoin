1. fix all typos of watermark generation
2. create LatenessWM, which controls final watermark by the "lateness" of event time of tuples
3. create ArrivalWM, which controls final watermark by the arrival time of tuples
4. create the WMTable to conveniently load all watermarkers
5. update scripts to test different syntax of watermark, i.e., by event lateness and by arrival time
